All datasets from the main branch of `ir_datasets` are supported by default.
We have a tutorial showing how new, potentially work-in-progress data can be imported at [ir-datasets/tutorial](ir-datasets/tutorial)

# Integration of ir_datasets into the Information Retrieval Experiment Platform



The integration of ir_datasets into the IR Experiment platform lives in the main branch of TIRA: [https://github.com/tira-io/tira/blob/main/application/src/tira/management/commands/ir_datasets_loader_cli.py](https://github.com/tira-io/tira/blob/main/application/src/tira/management/commands/ir_datasets_loader_cli.py).
